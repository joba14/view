## Overview
The **view** library is a header-only C library designed to create and bind views on sequence-like structures, such as strings. It provides a flexible and intuitive way to handle various views, and has extensions API for working with the **string views** specifically.

## Features
The "view" library in C distinguishes itself by offering a generic view structure, empowering users to seamlessly work with sequential C structures like strings and arrays. Notably, this library places a deliberate emphasis on user autonomy by abstaining from implementing strict memory safety measures, leaving users in control of memory management. This intentional design choice enables a lightweight and adaptable experience, allowing users to apply their own memory safety practices based on specific requirements. With a focus on flexibility and user responsibility, the "view" library provides a versatile tool for efficiently interacting with sequential C data structures while allowing users the freedom to implement their preferred memory safety practices.

## Getting Started
Using **view** library is straightforward. Here's a basic example of a string view:
```c

#define enable_utf8_string_view_implementation
#include "../include/utf8_string_view.h"

#include <stdio.h>

signed int main(
	void)
{
	const utf8_string_view_s sv1 = utf8_string_view_from_cstring("hello");
	const utf8_string_view_s sv2 = utf8_string_view_from_parts("hello", 5);

	const bool equal = utf8_string_view_equal(sv1, sv2);
	printf("sv1 == sv2 => %s\n", equal ? "true" : "false");

	printf(utf8_fmt "\n", utf8_arg(
		utf8_string_view_from_cstring("+++++hello+++++")
	));

	printf(utf8_fmt "\n", utf8_arg(
		utf8_string_view_trim_left(
			utf8_string_view_from_cstring("+++++hello+++++"), '+'
		)
	));

	printf(utf8_fmt "\n", utf8_arg(
		utf8_string_view_trim_right(
			utf8_string_view_from_cstring("+++++hello+++++"), '+'
		)
	));

	printf(utf8_fmt "\n", utf8_arg(
		utf8_string_view_trim(
			utf8_string_view_from_cstring("+++++hello+++++"), '+'
		)
	));

	return 0;
}
```
